# NLP-Analysing-AI-Impact-In-Crafting-Future-Work-Landscape

## Objective
In March of 2023, Goldman Sachs published a report, indicating that ~25% of the tasks in US and Europe can be automated using AI.  However, not all industries will be affected equally. According to the report, certain jobs, like office tasks, legal, architecture and social sciences have a potential for 30%+ automation, while positions like construction, installation and building maintenance are going to be largely unaffected.

The project aims to identify what types of tasks and jobs are most likely to see the biggest impact from AI by extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text.
